## Instructions


- Download this: <i class="far fa-file-archive"></i> [`ps-controls`](/files/ps-controls.zip)

- **unzip** it, then double-click on the `.Rproj` file to open RStudio. Note: if you don't open `Rproj` the code will not work!

- Ensure that you have the needed packages installed on your computer. If you try to run `library(PACKAGE NAME)` and R returns an error that the package is missing, use the “Packages” panel in RStudio to install it

- Replace the `your-name` part of the R Markdown file `your-name_problem-set-1.Rmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio

- Complete the tasks in the R Markdown file. Fill out code in the empty chunks provided and replace FILL YOUR ANSWER HERE with your answers to the questions.

- When you’re all done, click on the “Knit” button at the top of the editing window and create a Word document of your problem set. Submit **only the Word doc** to Blackboard.
